## Design Prototype
- Make 5 unique working design prototypes, each distinctly different from all the others
- Only use a handful of google fonts to rotate through, focus on the user experience design
- Each design prototype should be under a different react route
- Prototype should be clickable and interactive but don't bother doing any backend
- Use frontend-design skill
