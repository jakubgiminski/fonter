# Fonter

Fonter is a single-screen React + TypeScript app for testing font pairings in realistic content layouts.

## What It Does

The app lets you pick two font roles:

- Primary font
- Secondary font

It then renders those fonts in a live preview so you can quickly evaluate combinations across different layout types and content styles.
