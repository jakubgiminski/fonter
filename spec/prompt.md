- Support desktop and mobile layouts.
- Use a curated Google Font pool for pairing exploration.

## Functional requirements
- Two font roles: primary and secondary.
- Four preview layouts: Hero, Brief, Essay, Quote.
- Author-based content switching.
- Shuffle with one-at-a-time lock behavior for primary/secondary fonts.
